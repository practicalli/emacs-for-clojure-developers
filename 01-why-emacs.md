# Why emacs

Its like a dinasaur with a jetpack
its an editor that is ultimately hackable.
Emacs can do just about anything and is a very powerful editor too.
There may be simpler tools and better "out of the box" experiences.
Its the flexibility of Emacs that draws people in.
Also has great language support
Leaning elisp is great fun.  Its relatively easy to read so its farily easy to incorporate other peoples configuration.
There is a great community out there.

programming languages are interfaces in their own rights.  Sees programming as an ejoyable thing in its own right.

The language and the editor are the interfaces
