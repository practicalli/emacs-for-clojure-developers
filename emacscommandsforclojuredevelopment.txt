## Emacs commands for Clojure development

[![](images/emacs_logo.png)](http://files.fosswire.com/2010/06/emacs_logo.png)

_**Update: Its nearly two years since I wrote this book and therefore several years since starting my journey into Clojure development.  Its high time I re-wrote this post!**_

At the London Clojure dojo we use the amazing environment of Emacs to write and run our tests and code.  Emacs is a very powerful environment, more than just the editor it seems at first glance and using a tool written in Lisp is very fitting considering we are learning Clojure, a dialect of Lisp.

As we have emacs set up to be driven by keyboard shortcuts (as we only get 10 minutes each to code) I have made a crib sheet for the most common keyboard shortcuts and commands.

**Running the Clork project**  
Once you have Emacs and Leiningen set up and have downloaded the clork code, you can use the project using these steps

In a terminal window, change to the root of the clork project.  Run the leiningen command to run Swank

**lein swank**

You will get a message to saying you are connected to the Swank server

Open emacs from the root of the clork project and enter the following command to connect to the Swank server

**Meta-X slime connect**
