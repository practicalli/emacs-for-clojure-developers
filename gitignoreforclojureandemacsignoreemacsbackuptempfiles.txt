## GitIgnore for Clojure and Emacs - ignore Emacs backup & temp files

[![](images/clojure-logo-500x.png)](http://clojure.org/)  
_**Update: after a little more research I found a better way to manage my personal git ignore files **_

Emacs is the tool I used to help me start developing in Clojure and until LightTable becomes a little more feature rich then Emacs will stay my main tool for working on Clojure projects.

Once little self-inflicted annoyance I found was when working with Github.  I kept committing temporary and backup files that Emacs creates.  Yes, I should pay more attention and not just do a git add . but when you are running a hackathon as well as coding then things are hectic.

Whilst I could simple add patters to the git repository .gitignore file, this is not very effective for three reasons.  


  1. I'm adding my own preferences to a project I'm sharing with others, who may have different toolset.
  2. I have to add this to each new project I create / clone / fork 
  3. Pull requests can be blocked up by changes to .gitignore files 

## Creating my own global ignores 

In the ~/.gitconfig of my home directory I have a section called [core] where a global excludes file is defined

[core]  
    excludesfile = /Users/jstevenson/.gitignore_global  
    editor = emacsclient

By adding file name patters to the .gitignore_global file for Emacs, I can add my own personal excludes without adding unneccessary stuff to each project I work on.  It also means its one less thing to remember when I am working with git projects.

*~  
.DS_Store  
*~  
*#  
.#*

## Keeping project .gitignore files clean

Now when I work with Clojure projects using Emacs, I can commit away without having to worry about my editor add things that I carelessly add when in a hacking frenzy!

This also keeps the .gitignore files specific to a project much smaller and project specific.  
  
pom.xml  
*jar  
/classes/  
/.lein-deps-sum  
/.lein-failures  
/.lein-env  
/checkouts  
/.env  
/target
